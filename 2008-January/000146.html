&gt;<i> Varkon has been ported to the 64 bit environment of
</I>&gt;<i> a CRAY supercomputer with DEC Alpha processors. This
</I>&gt;<i> was a long time ago and that hardware is no longer relevant
</I>&gt;<i> but we know that it has been done and the #ifdef's are
</I>&gt;<i> still there in the code so it wouldn't be that much job
</I>&gt;<i> to do it again. (see below)
</I>
I have said before that I am no C programmer.  Please excuse me if I
write something stupid.  But, I thought it should be possible to use
an integer type that is guarantied to be the same size as pointers on
any architecture for integers that are involved in pointer arithmetic.
Again, I am no expert.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At the present time however, we are not maintaining a
</I>&gt;<i> working version for any true 64 bit platform. As I said,
</I>&gt;<i> if this of interest for you please let's continue the
</I>&gt;<i> discussion. Most important question is if it's
</I>&gt;<i> worth the job to do it or if there is something else
</I>&gt;<i> which is more important in the current strategy of increasing
</I>&gt;<i> the user base.
</I>
Yes, I am interested since I am working on an amd64 system myself and
I would like to provide a good solution for users of the amd64 Debian
port.  It would not be impossible to package a 32 bit binary into a
amd64 package, but it probably would be an ugly hack.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> About MBO files. Current MBO files store a lot of 32 bit integer
</I>&gt;<i> pointers. A true 64 bit version of Varkon could stick to the
</I>&gt;<i> 32 bit pointers in the MBO files, in which case MBO files would
</I>&gt;<i> run on both platforms, or take advantage of the 64 bit adressing
</I>&gt;<i> and use 64 bit integers in which case MBO files would be incompatible.
</I>&gt;<i> The same goes for RES-files.
</I>
It certainly would be beneficial if MBO files were architecture
independent.  It would help co-operation in mixed environments.

Alternatively Varkon MBS files as master and store MBO files in a
local cache outside the project directory.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you have the MBS files, you can always create MBO-files by
</I>&gt;<i> compiling them and RES-files by running the MBO.
</I>
I am still beginner with Varkon...

It seems like there are typically no MBS files for the active modules
of a project.  From the examples on
<A HREF="http://www.varkon.org/Examples.html">http://www.varkon.org/Examples.html</A> many MBS files are missing from
the job directories.  I guess I will have to decompile the MBO files
with a 32 bit Varkon.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hope this answers your questions. The short version is: No 64 bit
</I>&gt;<i> now but it is doable if we want to. Do we want to ?
</I>
Well, I don't know if you want to, but I would like to.

Of course, I am in no position to set priorities for you.  According
to the Debian Popularity Contest (<A HREF="http://popcon.debian.org/">http://popcon.debian.org/</A>) 13% of
all Debian installations are on the amd64 architecture.  And the amd64
share is slowly but constantly increasing.  So, I think this is a
significant part of the user base.

Whether you want to consider the 64 bit ports for the upcoming Varkon
2.0 release certainly also depends on how far you are away from that.
I would not want to introduce a major delay to your release.  Do you
have an estimate on when 2.0 might happen?

In the mean time it is probably best to just disable the 64 bit
architectures for the varkon package.  Users still can install the
i386 package in a chroot.  This is a hassle but better than random
segfaults.
