<PRE>Hello Johan,
&gt;<i> 3. One of the reasons for a compiler is to translate the
</I>&gt;<i>    code into something which is more effective to execute
</I>&gt;<i>    than plain text. Comments are not exeutable and most
</I>&gt;<i>    compilers strip comments out of the binary code they
</I>&gt;<i>    produce. So does the MBS compiler. It has been
</I>&gt;<i>    proposed that we change this behaviour so that comments
</I>&gt;<i>    are preserved during compilation. That would mean that
</I>&gt;<i>    MBO files would become larger (comments need space) and
</I>&gt;<i>    also that the decompiler would have to reformat coments
</I>&gt;<i>    the same way it does with code today. Would this be
</I>&gt;<i>    acceptable you think ?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>One way to achieve this would be, to store a flag for whence the MBO
file came, MBS or GUI and never directly overwrite user edited MBS.
Instead a 3-way merge could be done, so the comments get back into
place.
If the user deletes a block in the gui containing comments in the edited
MBS, this will create a slight problem, but it couldn't be solved by
keeping the comments in MBOs, because you need some sort of
anchoring of comment to code all the same.
Unless the user follows a know convention you will always have the
problem what comment belongs to what code.

Let's assume, the user added a statement at the bottom by hand and
commented it. Then he deletes said statement in the GUI and adds
something else. How would you tell, that this - say - pre-comment
is not a post comment to the previous statement and avoid
the new last statement to the old comment?
Ev. you need to store the whole thing as diff-chunks =&gt; that can't
be edited directly and you and up with an internal revision control
system...

Regards, Armin
