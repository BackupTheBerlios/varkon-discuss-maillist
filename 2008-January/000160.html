&gt;<i> Now to my question. In the varkon start window you can select to open
</I>&gt;<i> a module (mbo), which would then be regarded as active module. But
</I>&gt;<i> what if you only have this as mbs?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would prefer also to have the option to open an mbs-file as active
</I>&gt;<i> module. The first thing that I would expect to hapen is the
</I>&gt;<i> compilation of this to MBO, and then continue as usual.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe (i'm hovever not sure if it is a good idea) the file dialog
</I>&gt;<i> filter could do this automatically by showing all filenames (without
</I>&gt;<i> extention) that have MBO and/or MBS extensions. If MBO exist this
</I>&gt;<i> would be first priority to open. If MBO does not exist, the MBS would
</I>&gt;<i> open.  (or maybe this will comfuse those who are trying to understand
</I>&gt;<i> what is going on).
</I>
And if there is a problem reading the MBO file because of a
incompatible file format or whatever Varkon could fall back to
compiling the MBS.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another even more drastic approach would be to se the active module
</I>&gt;<i> mbo file as a temporary cache during execution only (at least for the
</I>&gt;<i> active module). Saving the job would then save only MBS file and open
</I>&gt;<i> a job would always start by compilation. Starting would be some
</I>&gt;<i> slower, but during work there would be no difference.
</I>
I really like this idea.  The cache could be kept between Varkon
sessions.  If Varkon reads a MBS file and finds a MBO file in its
chache that is newer than the MBS file it could use the MBO file.
Otherwise it has to recompile the MBO.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyhow, if it was easy ore even standard behavior to open MBS as
</I>&gt;<i> active module, you could after you have prepared an example for
</I>&gt;<i> posting to varkon org, strip your folder from all res and mbo -files
</I>&gt;<i> and. Thereafter create zip-file. The package would then be small and
</I>&gt;<i> portable.
</I>
And if MBO files were outside of the project folder it would be very
easy to share a project across the network.
