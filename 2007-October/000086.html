Please submit these as feature requests. You have a better chance of 
seeing them implemented this way.


&gt;&gt;<i> 4. What does Varkon need to make it more usable or better?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Total separation of core and UI; not just library separation. Make the

</I>&gt;<i> arbitrary number of views using MVC/three tier architecture. Have a
</I>&gt;<i> REPL of some kind to take commands; an emacs mode;).
</I>
This seems to be a popular approach. It sounds good to me. I'm anxious 
to hear what the guys who actually write the code think. :-)

&gt;<i> Btw, why is there no cooperation with BRL-CAD?. Both are written in c
</I>&gt;<i> and both are aiming to be parametric and implement proper NURBS tools.

I'll leave this one for the developers. I'm not competent to say what 
you could do here.

For the UI component, I'd be interested in tying Varkon in with 
something like Blender, though I haven't actually used it, it seems like 
it's very mature, highly thought of, and widely supported. At least we 
could learn a lot from seeing what they've done.

Blender has what seems to be a fantastic UI, built by and for people who 
do 3D modeling. The part they lack is the exactness of a CAD app. No 
dimensions, etc. But they are really on top of manipulating objects in 
3D space. That seems interesting.

If you look around, you'll notice that there are a lot more well 
developed 3d modelers for game development than there are CAD systems. :-)

Cheers,
Ruven
