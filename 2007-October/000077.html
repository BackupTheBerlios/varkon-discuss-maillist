<PRE>OK, just some toughts of a design engineer:

I'm working with high-end CAD systems for more that 10 years. And I can 
see as marketing and big corporation requirements has more, and more 
impact on those programs. When I compare Unigraphics V9 (1990) and Catia 
V5 I can see that these programs are for completly diferent users:

Catia V5 is a program for big the corporation worker. It allows people 
after a short training to build fully parametric modells according to 
strict procedures. I can easily replace one person in this job with 
another one. But I can't quickly change assembly structure or change 
something without respect to relations between objects.

I'm a designer. My tipical job is to design - for example a rear seat 
stowing system. I know some limitations - the floor shape, the normal seat 
posit ion and dimensions etc. But I don't know the exact solution - it's 
what I've to find with help of the CAD system. And I need as much freedom 
as possible. I can start with just crossections, reposition them - not 
according to some kinematics , but just my guess, then try to find right 
kinematics, then rearrange it again etc. Ideal CAD system for me is an 
explicit system with stron wireframe and surf ace modelling, with 
interface for transfering the 3D eometry into 2D views arran ged into 
drawings and the programing language to exten it and automate tasks. A nd 
in my opinian Varkon has power to do it.

There are many attacks on Varkons UI. I think UI is not so important. Have 
a loo k at VI - it has interface not similar to any other editor and 
people ar using V I. And not only those who got used to it - there are new 
users too. I like varko n's UI because it's simple, fast and independent 
from any special libraries. If Varkon can be VI of CAD systems, it's much 
better than being a poor Catia clone.

Best reards,
Maciek
