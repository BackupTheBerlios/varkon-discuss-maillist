I propose we have coding bees. In the old days, people gathered together 
to do labor-intensive tasks like barn-raising, or quilting, etc. The 
result was an item for one person, but each person in the group was 
entitled to get help from all the others in turn.

This would be different from a normal ongoing free-software effort, 
where the project continues over time. Here, the end result is code for 
one person, but the efforts are put into a common repository, 
Varkon.Org, so others can use it. This way we build up a useful repertoire.

I have tried to get production code out of people, but haven't gotten 
any really large or complete products. I suppose no one wants to give 
away proprietary code.

As an example, I'll volunteer to help you design an application to 
produce the bushings. I think I can do it as long as it's 2D. If anyone 
else has done anything with a nice menu system, I'd appreciate seeing 
the code to help me get started. If anyone else wants in, please let me 
know via the list.

&gt;<i> Sorry for the long email, but I felt that I needed to comment in detail 
</I>&gt;<i> about some of this.

We need more of this. People have got to say what's on their minds in 
detail so we can see what our problems are, and figure out how to help 
each other.

If we don't help each other out, none of us will get what we want in the 
end.
