<PRE>
Dan Falk asks:
&gt;<i>Can the mbsc compiler 
</I>&gt;<i>be used in non-interactive mode to generate such things as a file, 
</I>&gt;<i>without the aid of the Varkon main application?
</I>
What kind of file?  The output of the mbsc compiler is a/an .MBO file
(I've always assumed that this meant &quot;MBs Object,&quot; but could be
wrong.) If you put this .MBO file in the /job directory, you
can call the compiled module it defines from other modules,
including the Active Module.

But I don't think that you can get, for example a .PLT output plotfile
via mbsc alone, without running Varkon proper.  mbsc compiles a language
which defines a model, but I think that the model has to run before
it is &quot;really&quot; instantiated.

On the other hand, I just discovered yesterday that you can run
Varkon in batch mode (or more precisely, you can run the actual
executable, xvarkon, in batch mode; &quot;varkon&quot; is a shell script which
sets up an environment and runs xvarkon).  Hooray!  I haven't tried this
yet, but intend to.  So I would think that you could use mbsc
to produce object files, and run xvarkon in batch mode, and get
anything you would like out of Varkon without ever having the
graphical interface appear at all.

I don't know if this would qualify as &quot;without the aid of the 
Varkon main application&quot; - you are using the it, but invisibly.

  ----

BTW, I have found the following simple makefile (which I think I
posted to the list some years ago, iirc) to be useful in coordinating
Varkon/MBS.  Perhaps it will be of use to you; perhaps not.

The advantage is that, provided you adopt some simple
filename conventions, you never have to touch the makefile - it
figures everything out automagically.  It also gives you a preprocessing
capability.  So what I do is name all of my MBS files with a &quot;.M&quot;
suffix (vs. &quot;.MBS&quot;) and use the m4 macro processor to preprocess them
into .MBS files.  (This allows me, for instance, to have an &quot;include&quot;
capability.)  You could of course simplify this further by leaving
off the .M/m4 stage and just use the rest of the makefile to
automatically recognize MBS files and process them.

The only downside of automatic recognition is that every .MBS file
present is processed, so they all must be valid all of the time.


# A general-purpose GNU make makefile for MBS which compiles all MBS
# and puts the MBO object code in the ../lib directory
# Assume:  MBS source in files ending in &quot;.M&quot;
#          m4 preprocessor for e.g. &quot;include(constants.h)
# GNU GPL 2 or greater

ROOTS=$(basename $(wildcard *.M))
MBO=$(patsubst %,../lib/%.MBO,$(ROOTS))

all: $(MBO)

$(MBO): ../lib/%.MBO : %.M
	rm -f $*.MBS
	m4 $*.M &gt; $*.MBS
	mbsc $*.MBS
	rm -f $*.MBS
	mv -f $*.MBO ../lib

clean:
	rm -f *.MBO
	rm -f ../lib/*.MBO



All of this will probably look appalling to those who want to
make the GUI more accessible :-)


Anyway, hope this helps.  I hope also that others respond to your
question with further comments and other methods of using mbsc
(and perhaps xvarkon in batch mode), and in general other non-interactive
Varkon usage.  I've used mbsc quite a bit, but I tend to get locked
into one way of doing things and have never really explored it.

Regards,
David M.

     On two occasions I have been asked [by members of Parliament!], 
     &quot;Pray, Mr.  Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, 
     will the right answers come out?&quot;  I am not able rightly to apprehend 
     the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question.&quot;
