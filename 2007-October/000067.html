<PRE>
Dear Varkon list,

I have had the pleasure of having been involved in a couple of very 
interesting discussions off-list about possible features/futures for 
Varkon, and have had a few ideas which I have been encouraged to share 
with the list.

I would very much welcome any comments on or criticisms of these
thoughts - they're just ideas, and they may or may not be useful.
Don't hesitate to be critical; good critical discussions would help 
Varkon, and wouldn't hurt my feelings at all.


As a sort of a preface to this, I might observe that there seem to me
to be two distinct approaches to promoting and/or enhancing Varkon.

The first approach is to make Varkon more attractive to ordinary
CAD users who expect CAD to be an analog of paper-and-pencil drafting.
Once they're drawn in to Varkon and become comfortable with it,
they may the see the value of generic/process modeling and take
advantage of Varkon's more advanced features.  This seems to be 
the approach that Johan is suggesting on the list.

The second approach is to make Varkon more attractive to users who
might, for whatever reason, immediately see the value of generic/process
modeling. This might be done either by enhancing Varkon in these areas
or simply by explaining Varkon better.   Of course, this approach 
appeals to me, because the generic/MBS-related nature of Varkon is
what drew me to it in the first place.

Fortunately, these two approaches are not contradictory.  Indeed, they
are probably complementary.  

What I'll suggest as possible future items here, though, are all 
oriented towards this second approach.  They may, therefore, be
things that (even if they are worthwhile) might best be put on
the &quot;back burner&quot; for some other day.

They are also very much conditioned by my own background as a
programmer and as a writer (but not a visual thinker, which
may be odd given my interest in drafting).


In any event, my thoughts as to things that I would like to see in
Varkon in the future may be divided into two general categories:

   - small-scale items
   - large-scale items

1. Small-Scale Items

1a. If I had to ask for one single feature for Varkon, it would be
    the preservation of comments in the compilation of MBS in an
    interactive environment.  At present, if I write an MBS module
    by hand and load it into Varkon, the comments and &quot;whitespace&quot;
    of the original MBS code are lost.  

    This means that while I can use Varkon interactively to generate MBS, 
    I cannot use it interactively to modify existing handwritten MBS.
    This makes development more difficult.

    It also means that as a writer describing Varkon, I cannot simply
    say that Varkon converts between interactive use and MBS
    automatically or transparently; I must also have an &quot;except for...&quot;
    explanation.  This makes explaining Varkon more difficult,
    and makes Varkon less appealing to a potential new user.

    Preserving comments and whitespace would make the interactive-to-MBS
    (and back) conversion completely transparent in both directions.

1b. If I were to ask for a second feature, it would be the ability to
    write real subroutines in MBS (that is, not just other part() modules).
    I can get the effect of a subroutine with a part() call, and can
    even return values (via var parameters), but there have been many
    situations where I wanted to do something that was just computation
    and wasn't really a &quot;part.&quot;  It would be nice to be able to do this
    in a procedure/function without creating a part in the model.

    This may be something a bit like &quot;macro&quot; modules, but I've never
    been quite clear in my own mind about how macro and geometry modules
    may (or may not) be intermixed.

1c. I would also add a &quot;while&quot; loop to MBS.  This is of course not functionally
    important - you can do while-loops with goto and labels.  But
    in practical terms it may be difficult to get a programmer to take
    MBS (and thus Varkon) seriously without a &quot;while&quot; construct.

    This may also be simply a prejudice of mine.  For the computer science
    half of my undergraduate degree, most of what I studied was
    compiler construction.  So maybe this desire for a &quot;while&quot; loop
    is true only for programmers of my generation who happened to
    study compiler construction :-)

    Dijkstra's 1968 letter to the ACM on the &quot;goto&quot; still haunts
    programmers.


2. Large-Scale Items

   The importance of &quot;generic&quot; (or &quot;process&quot;) modeling in Varkon is that
   it can potentially capture not only the designed thing, but the
   process of designing it.  There are of course many ways to do this.
   The simplest is just the use of good programming style in MBS -
   it can be as simple as good comments.  Others, such as Gunnar Liden,
   have written systems for extracting documentation from MBS.
   Still other approaches are possible, such as my own desire to
   use MBS in a &quot;Literate Programming&quot; fashion (probably using the
   &quot;noweb&quot; tool) - but I acknowledge that Literate Programming is not
   something which has become popular (nor is it likely to).

   The following two items might, I think, add significantly to the
   ability to capture the design process in Varkon.


3a. Links from Varkon to Documentation

    Imagine a kind of an &quot;annotation link&quot; that might be added to any
    component of a model (any Varkon REF number, perhaps). 

    It would show up on the screen/model as an icon or symbol (which could be 
    specified or selected from a library of icons/symbols, or possibly 
    be user-supplied).  This might be done so that it always faced the user, 
    as text does.  On a mouse-over it might show the name of the annotation 
    link.  On a mouse click it would open the appropriate helper application
    (in another window) and load up the target contents of the link.

    In MBS, it would be a statement. Possibly:

        link (id, attach_to, symbol, mime_type, link, name, comment);
           REF id;
           REF attach_to;
           REF symbol;
           STRING mime_type;
           STRING link; 
           STRING name;         ! optional
           STRING comment;      ! optional

    It wouldn't be hard for a hyperlink-aware editor to allow the user
    to click on the link (if it is a URI) in the editor to bring up 
    the linked content.

    The icon/symbol could be anything drawn in Varkon.  It might be
    the result of using symb() to generate a 2-D symbol from a PLT file,
    for example.  This would be a handy way to distribute libraries of
    icons/symbols.  It might also be something drawn specifically for or in
    a particular model.
    
    The mime type could be anything reasonable - image, pdf, plain text,
    html document, etc.
    
    The thing linked to could be anything relevant to the design or 
    engineering of the model.  Examples:

        - a specification document for this model, part, etc.
        - a parts catalog entry
        - a data sheet
        - a standards document
        - a published engineering study in support of a design decision
        - a spreadsheet analyzing something (costs, weights, whatever)
        - photographs of tests
        - video of tests
        - a report of tests 
        - a patent
        - a statement of publicity/security level (public, confidential, etc.)
        - a statement of licensing terms for proprietary components
        - a link to another program which analyzes something
        - a text/html/pdf document by the designer commenting upon
          or analyzing this aspect of the design 
        - another Varkon model (useful, perhaps, when designing
          a coordinated series of things)
        - a third-party or historical model/design/drawing
        - a link to a discussion list archive (esp. useful for a public
          project; but possibly also in-house discussion lists)
        - a link to a bug/problem tracking repository item
        - etc.; the possibilities are numerous

    In short, anything that a designer has, which has influenced the design,
    and which can be identified, may be referenced.   In our networked world,
    most references will be URIs/URLs, but a reference could in fact
    be to a paper source (e.g., by a bibliographic citation, company
    document number, Standard number (e.g., ISO, DIN), or 
    a library call number).

    The &quot;name&quot; would be a relatively short-form but human-readable name
    for the thing linked.

    The &quot;comment&quot; field is just a free-form comment in case the link
    needs some further explanation (e.g., why it is linked, if not obvious).
    The STRING for it should be as long as practical.

  
    This would allow the model to be both a sort of a catalog which
    collects/identifies all of the documentation relevant to the design
    and also a structure which organizes way people access this
    information.  The model can become a 3-D geometrical &quot;index&quot; 
    into the piles of real-or-virtual &quot;paper&quot; on the designer's 
    desk-or-computer.
    

3b. Standalone Varkon viewer

    The opposite of being able to reference the world of documents from
    within a Varkon model is being able to reference a Varkon model from
    within the world of documents.  For this, a standalone Varkon viewer
    would be ideal.  It could be run by itself (much as &quot;acroread&quot; allows
    people to view PDF/&quot;Acrobat&quot; files), or it could be embedded as a
    helper application within a web browser (e.g. mozilla/firefox), 
    word processor (e.g., Open Office), prepress program (Scribus?),
    or other program (again, as &quot;acroread&quot; is, or as an SVG viewer is, etc.)

    It would be a read-only viewer which would allow the user to
    zoom/pan/rotate/level-blank the model so as to look at it in any way, 
    but not to modify the model.  The reason for read-only isn't so much
    security as data integrity (many people may be viewing the model;
    they can't all be authorized to make design changes).

    Here the ability to separate the model from the &quot;setting&quot; information
    is important.  A Varkon model might be distributed as an example
    on a website, for instance.  Several different documents might,
    simultaneously, link to the model and display it through the
    embedded Varkon viewer.  Each could specify its own settings
    (viewing angles, levels visible or blanked, etc.)

    Wouldn't it be great if pannable/zoomable/rotatable Varkon models
    became as commonplace in documents as JPG/PNG images? (!)
    (Scalable sort-of-interactive SVG is just now starting to become usable
    in this way).

    Or is it really already possible to do this with Varkon as it is
    (and thus just a matter of making Varkon as easy to install as
    an ordinary browser/other-program plugin)?


Anyway, these are just some thoughts.  I hope that you find them 
interesting.  Varkon is extremely nice as it is right now; I feel
a bit greedy asking for more!

David M.

There are two ways of constructing a software design.  One way is to make
it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other is to
make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
