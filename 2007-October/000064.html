<PRE>
Keeping settings/viewing/environment settings (JOB file information, 
whether it be in a JOB file, a RES file, or someplace else) separate
from the model, rather than incorporating it into the model,
seems to me to have two advantages.

The first is theoretical clarity - the model is a different
thing than how you look at the model.  Keeping these two things
separate is cleaner/simpler.

The second is more practical.  With separate model (MBO/MBS) and
setting (JOB/RES/?) information, two people can work on the
same model in such a way that each of them uses their own private
copy of Varkon on their own system, each with their own working
copy of the model, but the &quot;master&quot; copy of the
model itself resides on a central &quot;revision control server&quot;
(e.g., Subversion, or CVS, or RCS, or whatever).  The multiple
users may be separate in space or in time, and need not be
coordinated with each other beyond their shared access to the 
version-control repository.  This style of working will be familiar 
to programmers, and has become the norm for most programming projects.
As-is, Varkon fits in with this way of operation perfectly.

If the &quot;settings&quot; information were embedded in the model, then
each user would pick up previous users' &quot;settings&quot; information,
and in turn overwrite this with his/her own.  This would be an
impediment to distributed multiuser access.  (If other systems such
as Autocad are limited in this way, that would seem simply to be
an argument in favor of Varkon, not an argument to be like them.)

Of course it might be nice to be able to specify &quot;settings&quot; information
in some shareable form (separate from the model), so that one user could 
send to another user exactly (and only) the information about how they 
are viewing the model.  It might be nice if this were in some human-readable
form (e.g., a set of text statements) so that one user could share
these with another without forcing the second user to &quot;RUN&quot; the
entire environment of the first.  For example, say two users, A and B,
have both checked the same model out from a Subversion or CVS 
repository.  Say they've both set up their own environments in
fairly complex ways - different levels visible, different current
pen settings, different viewing windows, etc.  But say that A wants
to share just one setting with B - perhaps an exact view in a
window.  It would be nice if A could just send a human-and-machine-
readable settings file to B (or maybe even just one line of the file,
as text in an e-mail).  B could then just use the viewing
information, leaving everything else on his/her system (levels, etc.)
unchanged.

Just some thoughts.

David M.

There are two ways of constructing a software design.  One way is to make
it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other is to
make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
