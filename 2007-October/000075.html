<PRE>Hi Ruven,

It might take some time for us to digest and comment.  My long-winded 
comments are inserted below.

Ruven Gottlieb wrote
&gt;<i> Here's a little survey for everyone on this list:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. If you use Varkon, what do you do with it?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Truthfully, I have been using it to learn.  It has been more like 
learning a programming language than a design application for me and I 
like that.  I am also learning to program in python, apt360, and a 
little bit of C, so I like using MBS with Varkon.  That being said, I 
have not done anything 'useful' with it- no real projects for work.  
It's been like a hobby to me.   I started out way back in 1999, trying 
to use Varkon like a traditional design/CAD application, but I couldn't 
figure it out.  The interface was alien to me.  But, I'm a stubborn 
person and I have kept trying to understand it.  Only after I started to 
study programming languages did I begin to get it. Now, I see that there 
are things in Varkon that could be useful in my programming endevours.  
I would like to use it in a way similar to the way David McMillan does 
from the command line.  I would like to have python scripts 
automatically write MBS scripts and compile them and then use Varkon's 
geometric power to output drawings.   I am a beginner at programming, 
but I can see that there is real power in the Varkon source code.

&gt;<i> 2. If you don't use it, why not?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I do tooling design at work and have used Autocad, Unigraphics NX (just 
a little), and have to use Ashlar Graphite (2D) currently.  I can see 
that I could use Varkon to put out line drawings of tooling for the shop 
floor, but I need more time to develop a way of doing it.  I could not 
use Varkon to develop them in the traditional 'CAD' mode because I think 
that Varkon's interface is too clumsy for me to get things done fast and 
efficiently.  But, if I could work on setting up a routine for drawing 
parametric parts, I could really use Varkon to help me draw tooling 
components that have similar features.  I frequently draw adapter 
bushings that go into tool plates for gang tool lathes.  These bushings 
are simple- they have a shaft that has a consistent tolerance, a hole 
that has a consistent tolerance, and other simple features that can be 
defined easily.  I want to set up a menu driven application that a 
person working on the shop floor can use to generate a drawing that 
walks them through all the features that they need.
I haven't figured out how to make this work with Varkon yet, but would 
like to.

&gt;<i> 3. How does Varkon compare in any way with commercial offerings?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Varkon is totally different from the commercial offerings that I have 
worked with, but that might be because I have been using traditional 
'CAD' applications. 

&gt;<i> 4. What does Varkon need to make it more usable or better?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Like has been stated many times before, Varkon really needs a good user 
interface.  Right now, Varkon is too hard for an average user to 
comprehend.  I think that changing the menu structure to look more like 
a normal application would go a long way toward helping.  It needs the 
normal 'File, Edit, View, Etc..., Help' menu at the top.  Just doing 
this would probably help.  Updating the overall look would also help.   
I don't know how to describe the way that Varkon looks right now, but it 
reminds me of a lot of older X11 applications that I used back in the 
late 1990's with RedHat 5.2.  One might disregard this if Varkon serves 
a current purpose but new users are put off by the look and feel.  That 
is one of the reasons that I have thought about controlling Varkon MBS 
compiled code from python/wxpython or pyqt. 

I have two friends who are involved in CAD and computer programming.  
They have both migrated from the CAD world into professional 
programming.  One is a major contributor to the perl programming 
language.  I have discussed Varkon with both of them before.  They are 
both aware of it , have looked at it and found that they were put off by 
it's interface.  It seems that it intimidates both of them.  They are 
amazed that I know how to do anything with Varkon.

In another example of the interface problem, I walked two C++/python 
programmers who are working on the apt360 machine tool programming 
project through using MBS with Varkon, via IRC.  These guys are users of 
Pro/E,Solidworks, Mastercam, and other applications for manufacturing.  
We did some 2D drawing using MBS.  They were amazed at what could be 
done with MBS, but were commenting on how 'painful' the interface was to 
use.  At that point, they told me they would think about how Varkon 
worked, but couldn't really get into using it.

Another thing that the Varkon project needs is more examples of use.  I 
was very happy to see Ruven's website and the examples that he posted on 
it.  David's tutorial is very good.  But, we need more examples that 
really hold the user's hand through the tutorial to help them get 
started.  A simple tutorial on how to draw a motor mounting bracket, or 
a door, with examples of how to put out a dimensioned drawing, would be 
good.  For me, explicit examples of how to make a custom bushing drawing 
application would be interesting.  Start simple, then make more 
complicated examples later.


Sorry for the long email, but I felt that I needed to comment in detail 
about some of this.

Thanks,
Dan
