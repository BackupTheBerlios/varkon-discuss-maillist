<PRE>Hi,

The big picture is: How do we get more people to use Varkon ?

I think that an Open Source 3D CAD system which is easy
to install (click and run) and with a GUI similar to commersial
systems ought to have quite a lot of users. There aren't
many such systems around (if any).

I think that Varkon needs a beginners mode, where new users
can get familiar with the system without spending hours of
reading documentation. Just simple drafting. 2D at first and then
when 3D is needed just grow into 3D. Sooner or later some users
will want to do something parametric and eventually even write
MBS code. At that time they would have to switch to expert mode
and start reading documentation but at that time they would also
be motivated to do that.

All this is actually available in Varkon today but not easy to see.
Beginners mode is the same as explicit mode. In this mode you
edit drawings just like AutoCAD. Default is 2D but all you need to
do to go 3D is to change the current view. Expert mode is the same
as generic mode (default mode in Varkon). In this mode you create
or edit modules interactively or with a MBS text editor.

I'm very glad to hear that you appreciate the way Varkon handles
job data today. It works very well for expert users and I have
never thought of removing such functionality (I might not have
been clear on that point though). We already have JOB-files and
from 1.19 they are text formatted. What we could do is to skip
them in beginners mode (as a default) and only use them when the
user explicitly wants to. In all other cases they would be
stored with the model (drawing).

I'm very greatful for your feedback, it has clearly pointed out
that we should be careful not to &quot;destroy&quot; Varkon in our efforts
to make it easier to use. However, if you think that more entry
level users would be good for Varkon please don't hesitate to
mail any ideas you might have to this list.

Regards, Johan
