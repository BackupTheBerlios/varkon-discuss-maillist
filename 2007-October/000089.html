They may be; I'm unfamiliar with the 3D side of things. I mean to say 
that if you want the features you're referring to, please submit them as 
requests via the tracker, otherwise they may get lost in the shuffle.

It is my experience that if bug reports or feature requests are 
submitted, they will get more attention than if they aren't.

</I>&gt;<i> Blender is a toy in comparison to an engineering application and it

</I>
Perhaps. I'm only saying I think it's a very well done UI from a free 
software project that has alot to do with manipulating objects in 3D 
space, and that it may provide some examples to us. It's something 
anyone can look at or try out, as opposed to most high-end CAD, which is 
too expensive for most individuals to use in a meaningful way, i.e. lots 
of exposure/experience.

My problem is I am one of those unfortunates who don't have any exposure 
or access to the leading high-end commercial CAD apps, so I can't cite 
them as examples. I rely on those of you who have such exposure to do that.

In the end, our goal should be to improve Varkon so that it is more 
useful to more people. That's what I try to focus on. I hope all the 
discussion I've stirred up is helpful to the developers, and to all you 
on the list.

Cheers,
Ruven
