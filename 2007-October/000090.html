Thanks for posting this. I wanted to make a few points and hear what 
others think as well.

&gt;<i> Speaking ENTIRELY PERSONALLY here, I'm not sure that it is in the
</I>&gt;<i> end productive to think of Varkon in terms of competition with
</I>&gt;<i> other products (commercial or noncommercial).  Of course this may 
</I>&gt;<i> simply be my own world-view showing here!  While it is very important 
</I>&gt;<i> to see what other CAD systems are doing, being competitive means 
</I>&gt;<i> always being second-best.
</I>
Well, It all depends on what the definition of &quot;compete&quot; is.
(-: to borrow a phrase :-)

By &quot;compete&quot;, I do not mean &quot;imitate&quot;. We cannot ignore competition, 
because whether we like it or not, Varkon _automatically_ competes with 
_every_ other CAD program there is -successfully or not: Varkon competes 
for the limited attention of potential users who have to get a job done, 
and want to choose a good tool. Not many people have the time and 
_money_ to invest to become competent in every app; they have to make 
some choice based on what they want to do, what they can afford, and 
which app looks like a good bet to take the time and effort to become 
competent in.

1. Test this proposition by asking yourself, &quot;If money was no object, 
which CAD app would I use?&quot;. I can say personally that I'd look at them 
all, probably try several, and use whichever suited me for my kind of 
work. I might never have tried Varkon because there are several 
commercial parametric CAD apps out there that are _Ready_Now_. I don't 
know if they're as flexible as Varkon, but if I could afford to try 
them, or take training courses to exercise them, I would.

If the world's biggest companies, where money truly is no object, use a 
particular CAD app for the kind of thing I want to do, that is going to 
be a powerful inducement for me to try it too. These folks aren't 
interested in any philosophy or ideology: they want to maximize their 
ROI. We all do. We want to do the most work with the least effort.

2. We must be honest about Varkon's limitations as well as it's strong 
points in order to remedy the former and enhance the latter. We can only 
do that by seeing what users find important, and figuring out how we can 
offer that functionality to those users. This doesn't imply that we must 
do things the same way the other guys do; it does mean that the ability 
to produce the end result must be there. Think about cars. The object is 
to drive to a destination, perhaps carrying a load, etc. There are all 
sorts of ways to achieve that result, but in the end, that is what must 
happen.

 &gt; Imagine
&gt;<i> what Linux would have been if Linus had started out with a good
</I>&gt;<i> look at Windows and the idea that he had to &quot;beat&quot; Windows on its
</I>&gt;<i> own ground.
</I>
Even though Linus started out wanting to have a UNIX clone he could run 
on x86 hardware, and not thinking to compete with Windows, it turns out 
that Linux competes with Windows regardless of what anyone thinks or 
wants. It also turns out to do a pretty good job of it too. :-). 
Needless to say, Windows and Linux have borrowed things from each other 
over time as well.

   ... The problem with deliberately
&gt;<i> trying to be competitive is that being competitive means that you
</I>&gt;<i> let the other guy set the terms of the debate.  The one who controls
</I>&gt;<i> the terms of the debate always wins.
</I>
So you don't compete on anyone else's terms. You compete by providing 
the desired end result in the way you think is best. But provide it you 
must. In order to know what to provide, you must know the, um, competition.

&gt;<i> If the developers and users of Varkon simply pushed it to become the system 
</I>&gt;<i> (or systems) that we wanted it to be, that might be enough -
</I>&gt;<i> not to rebuild Varkon to &quot;beat&quot; any other particular system, but
</I>&gt;<i> to make it the best in its own terms.
</I>
Doing the latter accomplishes the former. :-)

...
&gt;<i> Varkon was built from the
</I>&gt;<i> start to be not a single system, but a very flexible set of
</I>&gt;<i> interworking and highly configurable components. 
</I>...

All your points about the modularity, etc. of Varkon are right on 
target. I think this is a great part of Varkon, and apparently so do 
lots of you.

As far as your tutorial goes, I think it's terrific.  I hope you can 
update it sometime. I put up the Wiki, so perhaps we can get some 
collaborative documentation project going.

Thanks again for posting your original message.

Cheers,
Ruven
