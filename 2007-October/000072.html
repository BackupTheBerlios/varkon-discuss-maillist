<PRE>Greetings:

In the spirit of:
<A HREF="http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/images/tlc0090.jpg">http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/images/tlc0090.jpg</A>
Substitute &quot;Varkon&quot; and &quot;SourceForge&quot; as appropriate. :-)

Throughout this diatribe, I refer to this article:
&quot;Comparing 3D CAD modelers&quot;
<A HREF="http://machinedesign.com/ContentItem/57411/Comparing3DCADmodelers.aspx">http://machinedesign.com/ContentItem/57411/Comparing3DCADmodelers.aspx</A>

First, I want to encourage, implore, and just plain nag you all to
please use the SourceForge site to submit bug reports and feature
requests. I see almost no one is submitting anything:

Are you telling me you can find no bugs in Varkon?
Are there no features you want?
Don't you want anything for Christmas?
Well, if you don't ask, you don't get. :-)


OK, OK, now down to business.

How do we want to proceed with Varkon development; what do we want it to 
become:

I think we need to have several timelines for Varkon development in our
heads.



There's the short-term one:

Let's fix things that really matter. Let's
get all the core functionality working. Varkon still has many parts of
the core that are incomplete or broken:

*rdims can generate incorrect
dimension lines (see my bug report),

*no native routines for generating ellipses, polygons, etc. We need 3d 
primitives too:
boxes, spher(oid|e)s, extrusions, whatever.

*Printing and formatting system still primitive.

*Graphical manipulation of individual entities and groups still
rudimentary.

*Can we make it easier to establish relationships between entities and 
parts, i.e. how do we stick things together? Sticking parts together 
graphically?

*UI still primitive. Compare the Varkon UI with that of Blender.

There's the mid-term one:
How do we use Varkon, and who is our audience?

If we really want Varkon to be able to switch-hit as an explicit CAD
app, we have to dramatically improve the UI. Look at QCad as a start.
The rationale for an explicit CAD program is it has to allow the user to
knock out a drawing or make changes quickly and easily, but with enough
features that the user can do anything they want. So, it has to at least
be better than QCad, or why bother?

I think Varkon has been able to get away with a primitive UI
because it was offset by the tremendous power of the parametric model.

Once we start thinking about explicit modeling, we have to give people
some reason to use Varkon. That reason would have to be efficiency and
ease-of-use. Not through being rudimentary, but through being able to 
perform the greatest number of operations with the least effort.

As far as the parametric side goes, what can we do to make building a 
large project easier?

I notice that most Varkon projects are really &quot;sketches&quot;, and I suspect
that one reason is that it is hard to build something really complete,
because as you add more parts, changing the model becomes more and more
difficult, or even impossible. Maybe we need to reconsider the whole 
model structure to make it easier to change once it is large. Some sort 
of object-oriented setup? I'm no CS grad, so I don't know what to do here.

We need tools to alter the model after it's fairly complex. I've been
toying with scripts to redo the part numbers throughout a model so I 
could insert something into the model at arbitrary positions, but
needless to say, it's a pain to do this reliably, and I haven't gotten 
too far with it.

If we really want to make Varkon competitive with commercial offerings,
we have to look at them and decide who we're &quot;competing&quot; with. Are we
after the Pro/E crowd? AutoCAD? SolidWorks? ParaSolid?

There are also several other systems I found when I Googled &quot;parametric
CAD&quot;. It looks like there is some kind of a split in the CAD universe.
Most CAD seems to have some parametric attributes now, but there also
seems to be a subset of CAD apps more like Varkon. There's some new
technology out there where they use models that aren't history based
(Kubotek's KeyCreator). Are non-history-based models as flexible as
history-based models? Are they more flexible? Do we need to consider
changing Varkon to keep up with this technology?

We need to modernize the MBS language: broaden it and remove some 
constraints like making MACRO modules general-purpose and callable from 
any other module type. Give parts and modules the ability to return a 
value to the calling module.

OK, I feel better now. If I make this too long, you won't read any of it.

Cheers,
Ruven
