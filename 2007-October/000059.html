<PRE>Hi all,

For those of you who have the possibility to download
Varkon from SourceForge using the Subversion ssystem
it is now possible to download Varkon 1.19B SVN#31.

Version 31 includes support for hatching and dimensions
in 3D. A hatch or dimension is always oriented in the
XY-plane of the currently active coordinate system.

This means that there is no longer any need for the
DRAWING (2D) module type. Everything can be done in
a GEOMETRY (3D) module. To make the system easier to
understand and use I therefore suggest that we remove
the concept of &quot;module type&quot; completely. There is only
one and it is always 3D. The keywords DRAWING and GEMOETRY
no longer have any meaning.

What do you think of this ?

Next step I would like to take on the route to make Varkon
easier to learn and use is to remove the JOB-files. JOB-files
hold information about current settings that do not relate directly
to a model. Which levels are blanked and which are not. Size
and position and view of graphics windows. Current pen, position
method, level, etc. etc. With current version of Varkon a JOB-file
is automatically created each time you save your job and
automatically loaded each time you load a job. You can delete
JOB-files if you want to. If you load a job without jobfile
Varkon will use default values for all settings.

Most CAD systems do not store this kind of data in a separate
file but rather in the same file as the model. In AutoCAD for
example all GUI settings are stored together with lines, arcs,
texts etc. in the DWG-file. I think that Varkon would be easier
to learn and use if Varkon was similar to other systems in this
matter. What do you think ?

There is a problem though. Varkon is not AutoCAD. Varkon can act
in AutoCAD mode (explicit mode, -r on the command line) and will
then create so called RIT files which are similar to DWG. In explicit
mode it would be straight forward to store the JOB data in the RIT
file. In generic mode (default mode) Varkon creates MBO files and
RES files. You can remove RES files to save space. The actual model
is in the MOB files and a RES file can be recreated at any time
by just pressing the &quot;RUN&quot; button. This separation of model and
result is a uniqe feature in Varkon that i have still not seen
in any other CAD system.

So, if we have no JOB files, JOB data has to go somewhere else.
In explicit mode it will go to the RIT-file, similar to AutoCAD.
In generic mode I suggest we put the JOB data in the RES file. This
means that as long as you keep your RES file with your job your
current GUI settings will persist but if you delete a RES-file
the GUI settings of that JOB will revert to their default values.

What do you think of this ?
