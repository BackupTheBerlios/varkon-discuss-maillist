OK, have you used Varkon for any of these projects? How did things work out?

If not, why not?

What has to be changed or fixed to make it better?

&gt;<i> There are many attacks on Varkons UI. I think UI is not so important.
</I>
Well, now, I wouldn't say thaaat... The UI isn't just the menu system 
per se, the UI dictates how you will interact with the system. If it 
wasn't that important, you wouldn't have a preference. :-)

If you're saying &quot;I don't want a UI like &lt;commercial product&gt; with too 
much junk on it, or too much clicking to do anything, I agree.

There's a lot of good stuff in the Varkon UI. It's compact, and 
efficient, but I do think it needs a combination of what it has and what 
some other systems have to make it more usable.

Is there anything you don't like about Varkon? We need to know. Not to 
diminish Varkon, but to remove the blemishes we have to identify them.

You have a lot of experience with many CAD systems. That's very 
important to help us choose the best of what's available to choose from.

I think the commercial systems have some things to teach us. After all, 
if they are bad, people will move to another system, no? They have to 
provide their customers what they need and want to do a job efficiently.

Am I wrong? I assume CAD users have a choice. If the CAD environment is 
like that of Microsoft and Word then I am wrong. Microsoft does what it 
likes with Word, and hang the users.

&gt;<i> Have 
</I>&gt;<i> a loo k at VI - it has interface not similar to any other editor and 
</I>&gt;<i> people ar using V I. And not only those who got used to it - there are new 
</I>&gt;<i> users too. I like varko n's UI because it's simple, fast and independent

</I>&gt;<i> better than being a poor Catia clone.
</I>
I love vi and use it all the time too. Others hate it and love emacs. It 
all depends on how you like to work. I think we can learn from everyone. 
Emacs and vi were developed in radically different environments to meet 
different needs.

It may be that Varkon can eventually be modularized so that people have 
a choice of UI. Think of the division of X and window-managers. (Thanks 
to David McMillan for the idea)

What we need is functionality. As one of the other respondents said 
&quot;interactive zoom, pan/ rotate/floating toolbars etc&quot;. I don't have any 
problem with Varkon's menu system per se, I have a problem with lack of 
functionality where it exists.

Especially in the case of an explicit CAD app, the UI is everything: How 
do you move entities or groups? Change entities, attributes? We have to 
include everything we need to have, without putting in things we don't 
need. That sounds like another reason to make the UI customizable or 
modular, so people can choose.

We shouldn't copy anyone in particular, but we also have to pay 
attention to what people are saying, and if lots of people are 
complaining that the UI is a problem, we have to figure out how to deal 
with that. Whether it's educating the users, changing the UI, or both, 
we have to figure out how much of each to do.

I hope the developers are getting good data from all this. I appreciate 
your responses.

Cheers,
Ruven
