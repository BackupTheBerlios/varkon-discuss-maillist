<PRE>
I was discussing some of the Varkon direction/futures matters
offlist with another listmember, and he asked that I post to the
list some of the comments I made to him.  I will here, but I do
so with a bit of trepidation.  These are very general, orientation-
style thoughts; by way of contrast it seems to me that the most
valuable parts of the present lively discussion of Varkon have 
been the many very specific ideas.  So take these with even more
than the usual grain of salt!


The first of these two matters had to do with the perspective or
reason one might have for wanting to enhance Varkon.  Some of this
has been framed recently in terms of explicitly competing with other
noncommercial and commercial offerings.

Speaking ENTIRELY PERSONALLY here, I'm not sure that it is in the
end productive to think of Varkon in terms of competition with
other products (commercial or noncommercial).  Of course this may 
simply be my own world-view showing here!  While it is very important 
to see what other CAD systems are doing, being competitive means 
always being second-best.  I know this is heresy in our society,
but I am, more and more, coming to believe it to be true.  Imagine
what Linux would have been if Linus had started out with a good
look at Windows and the idea that he had to &quot;beat&quot; Windows on its
own ground.  Linux would have been &quot;more Windows than Windows.&quot;
Instead, Linus set out to do something he wanted to do (write an
operating system) and looked around for the best model he could
find (POSIX), and went on his own path.  The problem with deliberately
trying to be competitive is that being competitive means that you
let the other guy set the terms of the debate.  The one who controls
the terms of the debate always wins.

If the developers and users of Varkon simply pushed it to become the system 
(or systems) that we wanted it to be, that might be enough -
not to rebuild Varkon to &quot;beat&quot; any other particular system, but
to make it the best in its own terms.

Anyway, I really don't want this to explode into a long thread on
the philosophical/political/economic implications of my heretical
perspective!  It just seems to me that we can look around at the
rest of the CAD world without locking ourselves into any specific
competitive mode.


The second matter I was discussing offlist may have become less
relevant now simply because it's been discussed onlist several
times in the last couple of days.  It doesn't seem to me that
Varkon needs to be just one thing.  (And the point has been made
on-list that with a clean separation of the guts of the system
from the user interface, this is quite possible.)
This is actually something which is ALREADY present in Varkon;
we just need to take advantage of it.  Varkon was built from the
start to be not a single system, but a very flexible set of
interworking and highly configurable components.   The &quot;out of the box&quot; 
user interface is just a sort of a default/demonstration interface which 
lets you work with the Varkon tools in one way.  It doesn't
really define what Varkon is (in the way that the UI of a more
conventional CAD system might define what that system is).
Even without any new interface components at all, Varkon can be 
adapted/customized significantly (e.g., the menu design can be changed by 
the user, in MDF files; models can create their own popup window dialogs;
models themselves can load up and change MDF menu definition files).
This is one aspect of Varkon that makes a programmer all tingly -
you can access nearly everything from nearly everything else
(a Varkon model can actually create its own unique Varkon UI).
Indeed, as I understand it, Varkon was built to be not so much a
single CAD application as a toolkit for building CAD applications.

So it may well be that there should be several different &quot;Varkons,&quot;
each of which is a different way of using the underlying toolbox.
One might easily have a current-style (1.19B, or earlier even) interface,
a &quot;drop-down menu conventional-looking&quot; interface, some other
interface entirely, yet another interface, and MBS-programming-style 
use all at the same time, all as Varkon.  So long as the functional core 
remained the same, they would all be mutually compatible.
(Others have made this point well in the last couple of days.)

In theory at least, even Varkon as-is can take the notion of 
discipline-specific versions of a CAD program (&quot;architecture version,&quot;
&quot;mechanical engineering version,&quot; etc.) even further - down to
the individual project level.  Each individual Varkon model can
(already) have its own specific user-interface which contains
and organizes only those UI buttons/menus/popups/etc. relevant to it.
While I can't imagine every CAD user becoming a UI designer as well
(though we have turned every business memo-writer into a typographer,
it seems), I can easily imagine a UI tailored to some specific
model being used by many other related models.


In any event, these are just a couple of large-scale observations.
Thanks for your patience.  Take them for what they're worth, or 
not worth; or not at all.  It's probably best to ignore them
and to return to the very good, very specific, comments about 
Varkon that have been appearing on the list these past few days.
(For which, thanks!  Speaking as another user, but a significantly
less experienced one, these comments have been fascinating to me.
Please continue!)


Oh, and one final remark since mention has been made of my &quot;Tutorial.&quot;
Thanks for the kind comment - but it doesn't deserve it.
I am only too aware that my &quot;tutorial&quot; is unfinished, wasn't very
good in the first place, and is now severly out of date.
I decided some time ago that it wasn't satisfactory to try to
complete it, but that instead I should re-start from scratch.
I've been working at this, but don't have anything to put
online yet.  The current spirited Varkon discussions have, however,
been lighting a bit of a fire under me.  I'll let the list know
when there are bits worth seeing.  I would also encourage every/anyone
to write their own user notes / documentation / tutorials / whatever
about Varkon.  There is no one right way to write about any subject -
the more different writers/views/styles, the better.  

Regards,
David M.
