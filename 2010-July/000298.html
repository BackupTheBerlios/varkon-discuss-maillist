<PRE>Gunnar,

Ah, interesting news!  I'm a developer on BRL-CAD, and we are working
with the OpenNURBS library to support NURBS.  I was curious how much
progress Varkon had made with the NURBS analysis algorithms since
that's one of the major things OpenNURBS does not supply (naturally
enough - the Rhino developers supply that functionality commercially,
so it stands to reason they wouldn't put it in the open library).

If I may ask, which algorithm is the new work using?  I noticed Ling
Huang's 1997 paper online:

A Practical Algorithm for Surface/Surface Intersection
<A HREF="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~hling/research/paper/intersection.htm">http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~hling/research/paper/intersection.htm</A>

Of course there's also NURBS approximation of surface/surface
intersection curves in Springer
(<A HREF="http://www.springerlink.com/content/x3665206243u20x8/">http://www.springerlink.com/content/x3665206243u20x8/</A>) but I haven't
coughed up the $34 yet to see how helpful that might be.

As far as practical, active open source efforts that either have
solved or might be working on problems like surface/surface, I know of
only three projects besides BRL-CAD and Varkon (and of course
OpenNURBS, but they're intentionally limited in scope):

SISL of course has published their source code
(<A HREF="http://www.sintef.no/Informasjons--og-kommunikasjonsteknologi-IKT/Anvendt-matematikk/Fagomrader/Geometri/Prosjekter/The-SISL-Nurbs-Library/SISL-Homepage/">http://www.sintef.no/Informasjons--og-kommunikasjonsteknologi-IKT/Anvendt-matematikk/Fagomrader/Geometri/Prosjekter/The-SISL-Nurbs-Library/SISL-Homepage/</A>),
but it's under GPL and so regrettably not viable for use directly in
an LGPL project.  They license commercially and the site suggests the
GPL was very carefully chosen to preserve the potential for commercial
licenses (like OpenNURBS, a reasonable position), so my estimate is
they are unlikely to consider switching to LGPL.  Their library dates
back to 1988, but thus far I haven't found any papers they have
published detailing their algorithms - does anyone know of any?

Ayam (<A HREF="http://ayam.sourceforge.net">http://ayam.sourceforge.net</A>) is BSD licensed and has a lot of
impressive NURBS modeling routines that would would probably be of
interest to a general NURBS library, but unless I've missed something
it does not do general surface/surface intersections but instead used
CSG rendering via the GPL OpenCSG library.

Blender has been working on NURBS for a number of years, but I'm not
sure of their current status and like SISL they're fully GPL, hence
not usable for Varkon and BRL-CAD.  (Or BRL-CAD at least - we can't
mix GPL and LGPL.)

There are a smattering of other libraries such as NURBS++, which is
LGPL, but I don't of any that are either actively developed or have
solved the surface/surface problem.  Does this summary agree with the
knowledge of the Varkon devs?

It's rather interesting that almost every open source project I know
of using or working on NURBS has its own format and routines.  This I
suppose is a natural consequence of their being so little work on the
topic early on that each project was effectively &quot;on its own&quot; or, like
Varkon and (I believe) SISL, started life intending to be commercial
and thus needed their own routines.

If I may, I would to ask the Varkon developers if there is any
interest in the possibility of focusing efforts on a common LGPL
library, perhaps based on the OpenNURBS library, that could serve as a
sort of &quot;common foundation&quot; for the various open source efforts?  (I
should stress that this is just me as an individual sounding out
interest - I don't really have a concrete, detailed plan in mind yet.)
 We all have to solve the same basic geometry problems before we can
get to the &quot;good stuff&quot; - a concerted effort to gather up the various
pieces from Ayam, Varkon and BRL-CAD as well as NURBS++ and any other
stray license compatible code and make a robust library (I would
suggest on top of OpenNURBS) under LGPL would be a benefit to us all.
The main stumbling block of course is that we all have our own formats
for NURBS, but with any luck a simple translation between various
representations wouldn't be especially difficult and we could all use
the same routines (or consolidate on one common format, although I
expect that would be harder.)  Is there any interest in discussing
such a project?

Cheers,
CY
