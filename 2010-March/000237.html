<PRE>Hi Armin,

My apologies for responding out of sequence (I got your message
only with the digest).

Developing a widget toolkit from scratch sounds too heroic
for me. Even aside from the initial effort, it means losing the
benefit of continued development by others on something more
widely used.

Probably we must be very careful about drawing conclusions
about how widgets look. The Varkon I just compiled myself (in
Debian Linux) does not look very good to me, but that could easily
be because I haven't looked into FLTK settings or am even missing
some library that should be there. Certainly I know GTK+ is very
very configurable. So even aside from different opinions, we
can easily be looking at quite different things.

Personally I think GTK+ looks very nice, and I believe the artists
that designed GIMP knew what they were doing. I would even
consider using GTK+ across platforms, despite expecting a
performance hit. But I think the user experience is better with
something that at least looks like native widgets.

I can't speak for the wxWidgets API. Certainly, on seeing that
it is presented as an application framework, I would expect
annoyance in getting started. But I think we can reasonably
hope that increasingly wide use of wxWidgets will have resulted
in fixing some of the problems that bothered you before.

John
