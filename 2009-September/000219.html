<PRE>Hello Xwang,

my answer here is not authoritative, but may help you
&gt;<i> I'm studyiing the possibility to use varkon to model the external 
</I>&gt;<i> surface of airplanes and cars to use them for CFD calculation (I need 
</I>&gt;<i> the surface in STL format).
</I>&gt;<i> So I wonder if:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) is Varkon still in development?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>yes (this is definitive)
&gt;<i> 2) is there any release plan somewhere?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>the main author is Dr. Kjellander - he has the say on this
&gt;<i> 3) would you push it in some distro repository?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>some people asked for this and maybe someone volunteered, but the 
compilation on Linux
is pretty easy and described; there is a binary package, that should be 
distribution independent
&gt;<i> 4) is it possible to export geometries in STL format?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I don't know this; looking at the description of STL in wikipedia, given 
a u,v-surface,
generation of triangle-strips with no connectivity should be trivial
&gt;<i> 5) if a join a wing to a fuselage, can I use some sort of boolean 
</I>&gt;<i> operation to cut the part of the wing which is inside the fuselage 
</I>&gt;<i> (surface to surface intersection?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>This is work in progress; I'm implementing an intersection algorithm 
(surface-surface
is done, handling of edges not implemented) and Varkon now has the 
ability to
express trimmed surfaces to hold the result. Dr. Larsen is working on 
intersections
as well from what I know. This part of my work is not yet integrated 
with Varkon.

The result of such an intersection will be a pair (or set) of trimmed 
surfaces, where
the trim-lines are a high quality approximation of the true intersection 
curve. As they
are expressed as splines in u,v-space on a given surface, isolines can 
again be used
to generate triangle strips for conversion to STL. Of course 
improvements like
adaptive spacing are possible - it's open source and you are welcome to 
help ;-)
The implementation of an STL-generator could be done in MBS or C - I'm 
not sure
which is better - with respect to my GUI-demo it could be C++ as well.

As I am interested in CFD applications myself, time permitting I may 
help with this.

Best Regards, Armin
