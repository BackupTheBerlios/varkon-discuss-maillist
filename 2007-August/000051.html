<PRE>Greetings!

As you may know, the Varkon team has moved it's official downloads and
website to SourceForge. The mailing list will follow at some point.

You'll now have all the benefits of SourceForge's resources to make
Varkon's development and distribution as efficient and effective as 
possible.

There are trackers for bugs and feature requests, so you can keep an eye
on Varkon's progress, and a graphical interface to the Subversion
repository so you can see what the latest version is. You can also pull
source directly from the repository to get the latest fixes.

The new version is coming along nicely, and there have been some
significant bug fixes.

In order to find and fix more bugs, and to polish the new user
interface, we need people to test it and file bug reports and feature
requests, so pop in and download the latest release, or roll your own
from SVN.

Is everyone on vacation? I seem to be the only one annoying the 
developers right now.

Since I want to encourage the use of the SourceForge site as the focal
point of Varkon development, I have closed The Lofting Floor forum on
Varkon.Org. Please use the forum on SourceForge for all discussions
related to Varkon. As was stated by Dr. Kjellander, the Berlios
mailing-list will still be used for the time being.

I would also bet that any developers wanting to participate would be
most welcome, so if you're interested, why not consider submitting a patch?

These are exciting times for Varkon; now's the time to make your mark on 
it's development.

Cheers,

Ruven Gottlieb
