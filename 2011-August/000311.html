<PRE>Varkon;
    I downloaded the pre-built binary for Linux.
       1)  The instructions made reference to the source code which I 
had a hard time finding/getting.  Sourceforge can be difficult to deal 
with and has a history of being less than adequate in policing their 
contents.
          A)  I was expecting to find a tarball of a reasonably stable 
source group.  The access to the SVN is in the initial text files but 
experience has lead me to believe that not all SVNs are stable code or 
even compilable.  I (and I think others) appreciate the source being of 
the binary given and all set to compile.
          B)  Instructions for doing things are not always clear.  Bad 
grammar I attribute to the language auto-converters.  The bad spellings 
- not sure where those come from.
          C)  When teaching the uninitiated it really is best use/show 
the rote method.  That is - the actual push button sequence.  
Unfortunate but true.  The translators can provide ambiguous statements 
from what was crystal clear in the original language.

       2)  Actually trying to use the program is very awkward.  I 
realize Varkon is more parametric than drafting but things like 
AutoCAD's polyline or Intergraph's line string need to be in existence 
in any CAD program.  To try to string together a few hundred line 
segments by:
             click create
             click line
             click (choice of   two pos  or  projected   -  difference 
not clear)
       just to get started and then
             for line(s)
                click the desired entry mode (abs, abs+rel, rel, 
rel+cur, abs+cur, cur)
                click start point
                click end point
                try to click last end point again or type instructions 
to use endpoint
                    and then try to get close enough to select the 
correct one.  BECAUSE:
                     in binary download 1.19D the &lt;end&gt; selects the 
mid-point and
                    cancels the line entry.
                click end point 
                repeat from try... to click...    again and again and ...

I'm used to:  To get started:
                          click button at top labeled &lt;DRAW&gt;
                          click choice (line or Pline or whatever basic 
element)
                      To do drafting:
                          click, click for line;  repeat for next one, ...
                                                OR
                      click,click,click... for multi-segments)
                      for &quot;on the fly&quot; help or change in input method:
                              if endpoint, midpoint or other specific 
wanted, right click, select
                                 which and click near enough to specify 
where/which.
                              for specific coordinates, just type in the 
comma delimited tuple
                              placement is mix and match methods &quot;on the 
fly&quot; as best suits
                      to stop, just enter nothing (right click, &lt;CR&gt; or 
&lt;SPACEBAR&gt;)

        3)  The Varkon &lt;RIGHT-CLICK&gt;  to terminate or return a menu 
level is not always working correctly.  That is a bug in the code.

          4)  The DXF import can't seem to find the file no mater its 
location.
                Specifying full path makes no difference.  I read all I 
could find and at
                this point - this is a bug or the documentation is 
incomplete of how to do.

On the dream side:  It would be nice to be able to place a raster (a 
picture) in the background and trace over it.  Even better would be for 
it to place the raster in real world size and place by reading a TIFF 
World File.   In case you want to add such a thing, the .tfw placement 
X,Y is based on UpperLeftCorner of MostNorthwestPixel. Other raster 
images sometimes use Center of MostNorthwestPixel.  So being able to 
shift incoming raster needs to be accounted for.  Size (scale of image) 
is simply accomplished
by multiplying Xscale and Yscale values times pixel column/line value to 
get upper left placement position of pixel.  Pixel offset is zero 
based.  Upper left pixel is 0,0.  Upper LeftGround position is X + (0 x 
pixelXwidth), Y + (0 x pixelYheight).  Thus a point 5 columns right and 
14 lines down would be located at:
 X + (5 x pixelXwidth), Y + (14 x pixelYheight).

example:
contents of sac-napa.tfw
20.000000000000                   Ground length of X
0.000000000000                     aways 0.0
0.000000000000                     always 0.0
-20.000000000000                  Ground length of Y (always '-' and =X 
for square)
298081.592832696270            Easting      (X)
4287483.560435335200          Northing   (Y)

6 lines, no comments, just the left side, left set.  Units (projection, 
meters,  feet,  Lat/Long, ...) are assumed to be known and within the 
file are all of same measure and origin.
The two 0.0 lines are for use in a matrix,  one is scale and the other 
is rotation.  I have never seen them be anything but Zero in actual day 
to day use.  They would be used if you were to be handling raw satellite 
output because capture is skewed and orbits are not perfectly circular 
around center of Earth.

The SVN I down loaded today does not compile.  forcing pointer use from 
an integer and passing too many tokens on the stack.  about half a 
screen of compile chatter and bombs out.

One congratulation is in order.  The binary downloaded and (after 
tweaking paths) runs.  That a pre-compiled binary does so is rare in the 
Linux world.  The binary is usually tied tight to a specific vendor and 
thus useless to the world at large.

Again, congratulations!

Steve
