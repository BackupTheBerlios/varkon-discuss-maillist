<PRE>Steve,

I'm not the main author of Varkon and I have to admit that I've become lazy
in last years. Large part of the critique you stated caused me to start my
own CAD application, beginning with a demo, that you can find at 
www.varkon.org
under &quot;GUI&quot;. It's based on the drafting method of varkon, i.e. explicit 
mode.
Recently I've been made aware, that for many people the binary doesn't work.
The .RES files you can create with it work with varkon though.

Some current fixes/enhancements should make it to that server &quot;sometime&quot;,
but color e.g. is inconsistent in my implementation currently. If it works
for you, you get the click,click,click,... behaviour for polylines e.g.

The main reason why people have trouble with my binary could be the OpenGL
library: I use the original NVidia implementation forced into Debian.
Try `ldd -r &lt;binary&gt;` if you have trouble and send me the output.

Personally I so far had hardly any trouble compiling varkon for me.
Then again, I may be seasoned a programmer and fixing a header or
compiler switch on the fly counts as &quot;easy&quot; to me.

Thank you for your clear descriptions and constructive approach.
It adds some motivation to my efforts, that I've been lacking
badly in the last time.

Best Regards,

Armin

P.S.: as far as I know there is no automatic translation involved

</I>&gt;<i>    I downloaded the pre-built binary for Linux.
</I>&gt;<i>       1)  The instructions made reference to the source code which I 
</I>&gt;<i> had a hard time finding/getting.  Sourceforge can be difficult to deal 
</I>&gt;<i> with and has a history of being less than adequate in policing their 
</I>&gt;<i> contents.
</I>&gt;<i>          A)  I was expecting to find a tarball of a reasonably stable 
</I>&gt;<i> source group.  The access to the SVN is in the initial text files but 
</I>&gt;<i> experience has lead me to believe that not all SVNs are stable code or 
</I>&gt;<i> even compilable.  I (and I think others) appreciate the source being 
</I>&gt;<i> of the binary given and all set to compile.
</I>&gt;<i>          B)  Instructions for doing things are not always clear.  Bad 
</I>&gt;<i> grammar I attribute to the language auto-converters.  The bad 
</I>&gt;<i> spellings - not sure where those come from.
</I>&gt;<i>          C)  When teaching the uninitiated it really is best use/show 
</I>&gt;<i> the rote method.  That is - the actual push button sequence.  
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunate but true.  The translators can provide ambiguous 
</I>&gt;<i> statements from what was crystal clear in the original language.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       2)  Actually trying to use the program is very awkward.  I 
</I>&gt;<i> realize Varkon is more parametric than drafting but things like 
</I>&gt;<i> AutoCAD's polyline or Intergraph's line string need to be in existence 
</I>&gt;<i> in any CAD program.  To try to string together a few hundred line 
</I>&gt;<i> segments by:
</I>&gt;<i>             click create
</I>&gt;<i>             click line
</I>&gt;<i>             click (choice of   two pos  or  projected   -  difference 
</I>&gt;<i> not clear)
</I>&gt;<i>       just to get started and then
</I>&gt;<i>             for line(s)
</I>&gt;<i>                click the desired entry mode (abs, abs+rel, rel, 
</I>&gt;<i> rel+cur, abs+cur, cur)
</I>&gt;<i>                click start point
</I>&gt;<i>                click end point
</I>&gt;<i>                try to click last end point again or type instructions 
</I>&gt;<i> to use endpoint
</I>&gt;<i>                    and then try to get close enough to select the 
</I>&gt;<i> correct one.  BECAUSE:
</I>&gt;<i>                     in binary download 1.19D the &lt;end&gt; selects the 
</I>&gt;<i> mid-point and
</I>&gt;<i>                    cancels the line entry.
</I>&gt;<i>                click end point                repeat from try... to 
</I>&gt;<i> click...    again and again and ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm used to:  To get started:
</I>&gt;<i>                          click button at top labeled &lt;DRAW&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>                          click choice (line or Pline or whatever basic 
</I>&gt;<i> element)
</I>&gt;<i>                      To do drafting:
</I>&gt;<i>                          click, click for line;  repeat for next one, ...
</I>&gt;<i>                                                OR
</I>&gt;<i>                      click,click,click... for multi-segments)
</I>&gt;<i>                      for &quot;on the fly&quot; help or change in input method:
</I>&gt;<i>                              if endpoint, midpoint or other specific 
</I>&gt;<i> wanted, right click, select
</I>&gt;<i>                                 which and click near enough to specify 
</I>&gt;<i> where/which.
</I>&gt;<i>                              for specific coordinates, just type in 
</I>&gt;<i> the comma delimited tuple
</I>&gt;<i>                              placement is mix and match methods &quot;on 
</I>&gt;<i> the fly&quot; as best suits
</I>&gt;<i>                      to stop, just enter nothing (right click, &lt;CR&gt; or 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;SPACEBAR&gt;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        3)  The Varkon &lt;RIGHT-CLICK&gt;  to terminate or return a menu 
</I>&gt;<i> level is not always working correctly.  That is a bug in the code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>          4)  The DXF import can't seem to find the file no mater its 
</I>&gt;<i> location.
</I>&gt;<i>                Specifying full path makes no difference.  I read all I 
</I>&gt;<i> could find and at
</I>&gt;<i>                this point - this is a bug or the documentation is 
</I>&gt;<i> incomplete of how to do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the dream side:  It would be nice to be able to place a raster (a 
</I>&gt;<i> picture) in the background and trace over it.  Even better would be 
</I>&gt;<i> for it to place the raster in real world size and place by reading a 
</I>&gt;<i> TIFF World File.   In case you want to add such a thing, the .tfw 
</I>&gt;<i> placement X,Y is based on UpperLeftCorner of MostNorthwestPixel. Other 
</I>&gt;<i> raster images sometimes use Center of MostNorthwestPixel.  So being 
</I>&gt;<i> able to shift incoming raster needs to be accounted for.  Size (scale 
</I>&gt;<i> of image) is simply accomplished
</I>&gt;<i> by multiplying Xscale and Yscale values times pixel column/line value 
</I>&gt;<i> to get upper left placement position of pixel.  Pixel offset is zero 
</I>&gt;<i> based.  Upper left pixel is 0,0.  Upper LeftGround position is X + (0 
</I>&gt;<i> x pixelXwidth), Y + (0 x pixelYheight).  Thus a point 5 columns right 
</I>&gt;<i> and 14 lines down would be located at:
</I>&gt;<i> X + (5 x pixelXwidth), Y + (14 x pixelYheight).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> example:
</I>&gt;<i> contents of sac-napa.tfw
</I>&gt;<i> 20.000000000000                   Ground length of X
</I>&gt;<i> 0.000000000000                     aways 0.0
</I>&gt;<i> 0.000000000000                     always 0.0
</I>&gt;<i> -20.000000000000                  Ground length of Y (always '-' and 
</I>&gt;<i> =X for square)
</I>&gt;<i> 298081.592832696270            Easting      (X)
</I>&gt;<i> 4287483.560435335200          Northing   (Y)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 6 lines, no comments, just the left side, left set.  Units 
</I>&gt;<i> (projection, meters,  feet,  Lat/Long, ...) are assumed to be known 
</I>&gt;<i> and within the file are all of same measure and origin.
</I>&gt;<i> The two 0.0 lines are for use in a matrix,  one is scale and the other 
</I>&gt;<i> is rotation.  I have never seen them be anything but Zero in actual 
</I>&gt;<i> day to day use.  They would be used if you were to be handling raw 
</I>&gt;<i> satellite output because capture is skewed and orbits are not 
</I>&gt;<i> perfectly circular around center of Earth.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The SVN I down loaded today does not compile.  forcing pointer use 
</I>&gt;<i> from an integer and passing too many tokens on the stack.  about half 
</I>&gt;<i> a screen of compile chatter and bombs out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One congratulation is in order.  The binary downloaded and (after 
</I>&gt;<i> tweaking paths) runs.  That a pre-compiled binary does so is rare in 
</I>&gt;<i> the Linux world.  The binary is usually tied tight to a specific 
</I>&gt;<i> vendor and thus useless to the world at large.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, congratulations!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Steve
