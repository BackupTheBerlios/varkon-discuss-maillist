<PRE>Hi all,

With only a few days left before a new year is started
it might be a good time to update you on what is
going on with Varkon and also ask you a couple of questions.

As you all know, the main focus with the development towards
Varkon 2.0 is to make Varkon easier to use. Many of you have
contributed with good ideas of what needs to be done. In
short, they fall into one of the following 4 categories:

1. GUI

Some of you have proposed that Varkon should switch
from it's own GUI toolkit WP to an external toolkit.
gtk is an ovious candidate. For the time being however,
we feel that our resources are best used by updating WP
and not making Varkon dependant of an external GUI toolkit.

During 2007 WP has been updated with a lot things that you
have asked for. Tooltips, interactive OpenGL graphics, many
new dialogs, a new menu window, a file selector, a new context
sensitive help system and so on...


2. Documentation

Better docs is a usual request. A big job is now going on to
update the Varkon manual with tutorials, pictures, links and
much more. New sections for &quot;Application developers&quot; and &quot;System
administration&quot; have been added. The interactive context sensitive
help system, based on the html docs is updated. Many new doc pages
have been written.

By moving Varkon to SourceForge earlier this year we also believe
that Varkon now is more available. SourceForge services like bug
trackers and SVN source code repository help to document changes.


3. Functionality

More functionality is always nice but as the development right
now is focused on usability, new functionality has to be
second priority. A big step however is the implementation of
support for trimmed surfaces that was added earlier this year.


4. Microsoft windows

Varkon supports Unix/Linux and Microsoft windows. The main development
however, is done on computers with Linux. This means that a new
version of Varkon is usually available for Unix/Linux before it
is available for Microsoft windows. The latest packaged release
of Varkon is version 1.19B and this version is only available
for Unix/Linux. Since ther are so many large changes being made
to the system right now, we do not plan to release a Microsoft windows
version of 1.19B at all. Instead we want to use all our energy to
finish the development of Varkon version 2.0 and then follow up
with a version for Microsoft windows.


Now to my questions:

1. What more do we need to do ?

Please help us by downloading the latest version of the
sources from the SVN repository, build the system, run it
an give us feedback.

2. Would a new packaged prebuilt binary release of the latest
   version of the system (svn#65 or later) be appreciated ?

And finally, the Varkon community is growing stronger. Many
people have contributed during 2007, more than ever.
This is probably the most promising indicator for the future...


Happy new year and see you all in 2008.

Johan
