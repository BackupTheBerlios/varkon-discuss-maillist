</I>Originally I was constructing a FEM-preprozessor for a certain problem 
and wanted
to have a good visualization, so I started to create an OpenGL-display 
class based
on the widget library FLTK 1.17. This evolved into an attempt to create 
my own
CAD-application and then into a proposed frontend to Varkon.

The interfacing itself is done to the Varkon-DB-library, that implements 
the in-memory
representation of .RES-files as well as writing and reading them.

I deliberately choose FLTK, because it's a very intuitive widget set 
written in C++
and portable to X, Win32 and MacOS X. As Varkon is written in C, I made 
a wrapper
class to the DB library, that adds some sanity checking, that is 
normally done
by service routines in other parts of Varkon (e.g. you can't create a 
line of length 0).
In detailed discussions with Johan, we specified, how the interfacing 
may be shifted
from creating an explicit model using DB to generic models using the 
in-memory
representation of .MBO-files, because the connectivity information and other
parametric stuff is relatively easy to derive from the GUI.

But to enable rapid development on my side, till now the 
.RES-representation is
used for persistence and a set of external scripts and MBS-programs is used,
to convert these .RES-files to MBS-code if there is a desire to 
incorporate it
into a generic model. This was also done, cause with Varkon 1.18A a lot of
historic ballast and interdependencies between Varkons GUI and the
MBO-system exist. The untangling of these is one of Johans contributions
to a novel system, be it using parts of my demo or not. A step to this end
is Varkon 1.19.

There are certain issues with coordinate systems and circles in the 
back-conversion,
but lines, points and bplanes work perfectly, so if one desires to 
sketch a part
fast and then position it somewhere in a larger generic model, this 
should work
as desired. The description on Ruvens page is a bit outdated, as the issues
with saving and restoring files, stability of sweep surfaces and such are
solved several versions now and rock solid.

Today I added a primitive polyline implementation for the overlay animation
in spline creation (all red lines are overlay), that just connects the 
temporal input points.
It is a bit difficult, to do that correctly with splines, as this 
requires mathematical
understanding of the splines nature and/or the direct use of Varkons spline
creation routines, or the final stored spline will not be exactly what
the animation showed. I didn't get as far as extracting the spline routines
from Varkon yet. Splines and surfaces are for one complicated enough and
separated enough, to warrant a library on their own, and I know they are
handled in their own files. So clarity on that point should be easy with
Johans help.

To give you an idea, how the look and feel may be, I'll send what I have
now to Ruven and the code to Johan, despite the fact there is no permanent
storage of splines and therefore no editing like draging control points.

Best Regards, Armin
