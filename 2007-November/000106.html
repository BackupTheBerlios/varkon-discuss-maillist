<PRE>Hi,

As you all know the current development towards
Varkon 2.0 is very much focused on making the system
easier to use and understand. This involves issues
like GUI and documentation but also what files the
system uses. It should be easy for a first time user
to understand where his drawing or model is. It would
be nice if a Varkon job (explicit drawing or generic model)
could be contained in one single file, just like any
other document. This would make it possible to access
a Varkon job with an ordinary file browser, click on the
file name and Varkon starts and loads the file (job).

We have discussed this issue in the development team
for some time and I think we now have an idea that
could work...

Let's first review the current situation. There are 2
kinds of Varkon jobs, explicit and generic. An explicit
job is defined by 2 files, jobname.JOB and jobname.RIT.
A generic job is defined by 3 files, jobname.JOB,
jobname.MBO and  jobname.RES. On top of this, there
is also the PID-file that defines the current project.

Technically, there is no difference between a .RIT file
and a .RES file. Our proposal is that we skip the .RIT
file type and stick to .RES only. This means that you
can use Varkon in generic mode to create a result and
then edit the result in explicit mode if you want to.
Old .RIT files would be possible to use in explicit mode
by just renaming them to .RES.

Next change would be to remove the .JOB files. This has
already been discussed on this list and I see no major
problems with this. Basically it just means that we move
the .JOB data into the .RES file.

A final change would be to remove also the PID files from
the system. This may sound as we would then also remove
a lot of functionality but the fact is that the role of
the PID file can be completely exercised byt the start
script if you want to. New users don't need projects.
They want the system to act like AoutoCAD or Excel.
Start the system, create something and save the file
somewhere. Experienced users know that you need to
structure your data and also want to customize the
user interface etc. This can be done by configuring
the start script. Without PID files you would need
one start script for each &quot;project&quot; but since the
conept of a project is very user specific it might
even be better to use the start script to define it
than the current PID concept which only lets you set
up a few specific things.

In Varkon 2.0 a user working in explicit mode would
only have to deal with .RES files. A user in generic
mode would work with .MBO files but also see .RES files
be created automatically as he creates his modules. A
more experienced user would also know about .MBS files
of course and also start scripts to configure &quot;projects&quot;.

Please let us know if this could work for you ?

Regards, Johan
