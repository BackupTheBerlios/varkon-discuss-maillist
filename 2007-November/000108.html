<PRE>
By an odd coincidence, I was just yesterday writing up some 
revised notes on using PID files, and think finally that I've
managed to understand them and their place in the configuration
and startup/environment of Varkon.  So when I read Johan's 
posting today about eliminating them, my first gut-level reaction
was &quot;Noooooooo....&quot; :-)

But then I got to thinking, well, maybe, yes.

The information in a PID file is necessary for a project,
but it isn't quite as tightly tied into the project as
things such as MBO files and the like (the contents of an
&quot;app&quot; subdirectory).  In fact, if you have a project which
conforms to the assumptions of the stock interface
(&quot;job&quot;, &quot;mbs&quot;, etc. directories) and you have it located at
VARKON_PRD, but you don't have a PID file, Varkon will create
a PID file for it (without overwriting the project) 
(I just tried this yesterday - it's nice).

So it probably doesn't make much difference whether the 
information is put into a PID file or into a startup script.
As Johan suggests, putting the same information into a
startup script means that you can actually do quite a bit
more (since you have the shell to work with).

The important aspect of this that would keep such a change
&quot;Varkon style&quot; is that the information would still be accessible
to the advanced user in the startup script - it wouldn't be
buried away somewhere in the internals of Varkon, or put in some
inaccessible binary form.

One question would be whether you would in fact want separate
startup scripts for each project, or some mechanism whereby
there was a single &quot;starter startup&quot; script which was then 
fed a project-startup script as a parameter (or which had an
File -&gt; Open menu selection in a GUI).  This would have
the advantage of one &quot;point of entry&quot; for Varkon.
A related question would be how a new user would start up a
new project which didn't already have a startup script.
They could start with a standard script and do a &quot;save as&quot;
to get a new one (but you'd probably want to ensure that they
couldn't overwrite the standard startup script, otherwise 
their &quot;home project&quot; might end up being their first test project,
which might be disheartening).

So, yes, eliminating PID files in favor of putting the same
information into startup scripts might be quite nice.
If it could be done so as to simplify things for the new user,
that would be great.  For the advanced user, it would actually
make a more powerful mechanism because PID files could then
become shell scripts (in a way of thinking).

Just some thought.

David M.

There are two ways of constructing a software design.  One way is to make
it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other is to
make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
