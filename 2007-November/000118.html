<PRE>
Dear Varkon folks,

With considerable trepidation, I've uploaded a very rough,
mostly unfinished draft of a new set of notes on using Varkon.
It's at:

<A HREF="http://www.CircuitousRoot.com/artifice/drafting/varkon/index.html">http://www.CircuitousRoot.com/artifice/drafting/varkon/index.html</A>

As you'll see, most of it isn't finished yet - just the overall
structure and some of the introductory bits.  If an item is overstruck,
or if it's a category whose members are all overstruck, then it
isn't there.  Normally I'd hide all of this, but in this case
having a sort of public &quot;to do&quot; list might a) cause me to do it, and
b) be of use as one possible syllabus for studying Varkon.

I'm sure there are any number of errors in it, from the
typographical on up.  I would greatly appreciate learning of them.

In addition, there are two sections to which I'd like to draw
your attention and ask for your feedback.

The first of these is another attempt to answer the question
&quot;What is Varkon?&quot;  It isn't a simple question.  Here I've taken
a different approach and tried to answer it several times for
several different audiences.  The direct link is:

<A HREF="http://www.CircuitousRoot.com/artifice/drafting/varkon/begin/meta/what-is-varkon/index.html">http://www.CircuitousRoot.com/artifice/drafting/varkon/begin/meta/what-is-varkon/index.html</A>

The second section to which I'd like to draw your attention is
perhaps more important.  It's an attempt to compile a complete
bibliography about Varkon. Of course, if you spot an error in
anything I have listed there, please let me know.  Just as
importantly, if you know of any citation/reference that should
be in it, please let me know!  These don't have to be academic
paper references (though a large part of the current bibliography is).
Any published source which references Varkon in any way,
anywhere, at any time, in any language, in any medium, should be included.
The only sources I'm excluding are things such as package lists
for OS distributions and other (semi)automated references.
If it was written by a person, and references Varkon, we should list it.

<A HREF="http://www.CircuitousRoot.com/artifice/drafting/varkon/begin/intro/bibliography/index.html">http://www.CircuitousRoot.com/artifice/drafting/varkon/begin/intro/bibliography/index.html</A>

In any case, all comments on any aspect of these notes are welcome.

My thanks, also, to the several people who have helped me put
this together (though its faults are entirely my own).

Regards,
David M.

   Teaching by contrasts has great possibilities: but there are
   dangers in a strict division of &quot;right&quot; from &quot;wrong&quot;; for it is
   rarely that a wrong method is so bad that a good man cannot
   find some good in it, whilst the right way merely exposes
   itself for further improvement.
