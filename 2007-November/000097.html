<PRE>Hi,

It has been a great pleasure to read all the
mails to the list lately. Thanks all for very
valuable comments. I suppose you are just as
impressed as I am by Ruven's patient work to
promote the activity.

Now it seems as the discussion is cooling down
so I have gone through all the postings and
tried to extract some kind of essence.

- The largest number of comments are associated
  with the Varkon GUI in some way or another.

- Category number two is related to documentation,
  wiki, tutorials and examples.

- Remaining comments are more or less related to
  functional details. A while-loop in MBS and better
  functions for dimensioning are two examples.

- Finally there is also a discussion about development
  strategies. Which way to go and why.

As a developer I can only say that i agree with almost
everything that has been said. The Varkon GUI must be
improved, the docs better and more functionality must
be implemented. However this is just a matter of time,
technically it's not a huge problem.

The difficult question in my opinion right now is which
way to go with Varkon in the future. Some of you have
stated that explicit modeling is important and others that
generic modeling is more important. We could go either way
or we could go both ways. The real fundamentalists among
you even want to see a full split between Varkon core and
user interface.

I surley would like to discuss this issue further. Meanwhile,
please post any ideas on improvemnt details you might have
as feature requests on the Varkon project site on SourceForge.

Also, anyone having an idea of how to port the X version
of Varkon to Microsoft Windows, please let us know. I have
investigated and ruled out Cygwin for various reasons.
Xming has also been proposed but is only a X server, no libs.

Johan
