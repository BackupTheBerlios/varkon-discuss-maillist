<PRE>Hello all,

as I'm a secrete ship builder, splines are essential to me,
so here my working docu on how to manage splines ;-)

Methods to automatically fair splines
-------------------------------------

All methods to fair splines considered here achieve this,
by temporarily ignoring a certain control point.
Afterwards the control point is newly defined on the
segment combined from the arcs adjecent to the omitted point.
But the essential question is: where?

The best method to do this is dependent on the use of the
spline. In ship building, splines are used to define the
'lines' of a ship and the control points of a couple of these
splines are normally all located at the station planes.
Therefore the intersection of the faired spline with
the station plane of the omitted control point is where
the new control point shall be inserted.

Obviousely, for splines on an arbitrar design, there do
not exist predefined station planes and the above approach
is bound to fail. Another idea is to use the normal plane
to the original spline through the control point as surface
to intersect the faired spline with.

Yet another idea is to use the parallel to the screen through
the old control point or horizontal or vertical normals to that.

Based on the fact that this CAD-demo utilizes a grid-plane
to define input points, a parallel to the grid or the grid-plane
it self might be used for above intersection.

As it is easy, to orient the grid plane parallel to station planes,
three methods shall be offered in the CAD-demo:
a) the &quot;natural&quot; method using the normal to the old spline
b) the parallel to the grid-plane through the old control point
c) the grid plane itself


Manually fairing/modeling a spline by draging
---------------------------------------------

Like above the modifications are done by redefining control points
of the spline, in that case by draging them around. Again, the splines
are 3D-lines and the 2D-motion of the mouse can interpreted in
several ways:
*) the control point stayes in a parallel to the screen
*) the control point stayes in a parallel to the grid
*) the control point is bound to run on another (sp)line or surface.

To achive fine control on the draged spline, a &quot;lever-factor&quot; can
be used, to reduce the manual mouse motion to the motion of the
control point.
For good visualization, the curvature and torsion of the spline
can be expressed as vector plots (curvature is radial extent of
the vector, torsion is tangential extent, the orientation is
oposite to the radius of curvature).


At the moment I'm into the temporal representation and overlay drawing
for draging splines around or make them bend, as the user is trying
to decide where to place the next point. The handling will be similiar
to creating lines with the demo: you just place the points and right-click
if you want to start a new spline. If you rightclick twice, you get
back to selection of spline types and spline editing modes.

Best Regards, Armin
